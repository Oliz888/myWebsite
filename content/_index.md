I hold a Master's degree in Data Science for Public Policy from Georgetown University (Class of 2024) and a Bachelor's degree in Economics from the University of Nottingham, Ningbo, China.

💻 I am currently working as a software engineer, specializing in database engineering and front-end development. Previously, I worked as a data engineer, focusing on ETL pipelines, dashboard analytics, and cloud storage solutions. I have contributed to projects involving supervised and unsupervised machine learning, network analysis, and am currently advancing my skills in deep learning and Graph Foundational Models (GFMs).

🔍 As an independent researcher, I explore topics in crypto-economics, DeFi protocols, and decentralized governance systems.
